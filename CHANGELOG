  - Integration tests for ROS service API
  - E2E tests with Docker (ROS1 Noetic, ROS2 Humble/Jazzy/Rolling)
  - Pre-commit hooks for code quality (clang-format, cppcheck, clippy)

- **ci**: Multi-platform CI/CD pipeline
  - Separate workflows for C++, ROS1, and ROS2
  - Coverage reporting with Codecov
  - Docker-based testing for reproducibility
  - Parallel test execution for faster feedback

- **build**: Refactor CMake build system
  - Modern CMake targets (no deprecated `ament_target_dependencies`)
  - Auto-discovery of test files via `GLOB CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`
  - Unified Makefile interface for common operations
  - Support for both catkin (ROS1) and colcon (ROS2)

### Fixed
- **recorder**: Resolve thread safety issues in state machine transitions
