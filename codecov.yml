# Codecov Configuration for Axon

# Configures coverage reporting behavior and file exclusions.
# See: https://docs.codecov.com/docs/codecov-yaml

# Coverage Strategy:
#   - All coverage (ROS1, ROS2, C++ libs, E2E) is merged locally before upload
#   - Single unified coverage report for the entire project
# =============================================================================
